# dsi202_2025: Web Application 'Care Evry Home'
# Abstract
## Purpose
We started Care Every Home because we saw something happening in real life. Families struggling to take care of their loved ones at home, needing medical equipment that was just too expensive to buy. Most people don’t need these things forever, just for a short time while someone recovers or needs extra support. But the cost and the hassle can be overwhelming.

So we thought what if there was a way to make it easier? What if you could simply rent the equipment you need, use it for as long as necessary, and then return it? No huge upfront cost. No stress. Just what you need, when you need it. That’s what Care Every Home is. A service that lets people rent home-use medical equipment at a fair, affordable price. We’ve made it simple to use, whether you’re tech-savvy or not. You can browse equipment, book it online, and we’ll take care of the rest. 

And we mean take care. We deliver everything to your home, and our team sets it up for you. So there’s no lifting, no confusion, no extra work for you or your family. We know how important it is to feel supported, especially when someone you love is unwell. We’re here to make that easier.

This isn’t just a business to us. It’s a way to help people feel cared for. It’s for the elderly parent who wants to stay at home. For the patient recovering after surgery. The caregiver does everything they can with limited time and energy. At the heart of it, Care Every Home is about giving and receiving care with dignity, with compassion, and with the belief that every home can be a place of healing.

## The development journey was rooted in user-centered design:

- Defined key user stories to understand real-world needs.

- Mapped workflows and created paper prototypes to guide user experience.

- Selected a calming and accessible visual style, using a pastel theme and Noto Sans font for readability.

- Built using Django and Django REST Framework, ensuring a strong backend structure.

- Integrated TailwindCSS for responsive and UI.

- Developed features such as user authentication (signup, login, logout), custom forms, and RESTful APIs for scalable functionality.

## Community Impact
Care Every Home is more than a rental platform, It’s a digital expression of compassion. It helps reduce financial strain, supports those recovering at home, and fosters a culture of giving within the community. The donation feature encourages sustainability by extending the life of medical devices, reducing waste, and making care more accessible for everyone.

## Outcome & Future Potential
The resulting application meets all core user needs: equipment is easy to find and rent, help is available at every step, and the donation system brings people together. Its model structure and RESTful design make it adaptable for future growth potentially integrating health partners, volunteer services, or real-time inventory tracking.

“Care Every Home” is a small step toward a more caring, inclusive, and connected society where everyone can give and receive help when it’s needed most.
