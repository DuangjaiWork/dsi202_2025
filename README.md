## Abstract
  We started **Care Every Home** because we saw something happening in real life. Families struggling to take care of their loved ones at home, needing medical equipment that was just too expensive to buy. Most people don’t need these things forever, just for a short time while someone recovers or needs extra support. But the cost and the hassle can be overwhelming.

  So we thought what if there was a way to make it easier? What if you could simply rent the equipment you need, use it for as long as necessary, and then return it? No huge upfront cost. No stress. Just what you need, when you need it.
  
  That’s what Care Every Home is. A service that lets people rent home-use medical equipment at a fair, affordable price. We’ve made it simple to use, whether you’re tech-savvy or not. You can browse equipment, book it online, and we’ll take care of the rest. And we mean to take care. We deliver everything to your home, and our team sets it up for you. So there’s no lifting, no confusion, no extra work for you or your family. We know how important it is to feel supported, especially when someone you love is unwell. We’re here to make that easier.

  This isn’t just a business to us. It’s a way to help people feel cared for. It’s for the elderly parent who wants to stay at home. For the patient recovering after surgery. The caregiver does everything they can with limited time and energy. At the heart of it, Care Every Home is about giving and receiving care—with dignity, with compassion, and with the belief that every home can be a place of healing.
