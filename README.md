# dsi202_2025: Web Application 'Care Evry Home'
# Abstract
## Purpose
   In an era where quality home medical care is increasingly necessary yet financially burdensome, many families face the challenge of accessing essential medical equipment that is expensive and often underused. “Care Every Home” addresses this gap by offering an empathetic, community-oriented solution: an easy-to-use web platform that allows individuals to rent home-use medical equipment at affordable rates, with added support for delivery, setup, and donation.
   Patients recovering at home, the elderly, and those with mobility limitations often need temporary access to medical tools like wheelchairs, hospital beds, or oxygen machines. Buying such equipment is costly and may not be practical for short-term use. At the same time, others in the community may have unused equipment they wish to donate. Care Every Home connects these needs—enabling care, sharing, and sustainability through a unified digital service.
